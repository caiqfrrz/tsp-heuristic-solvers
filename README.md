# tsp-heuristic-solvers

**Authors:** Caique Ferraz and Guilherme Peruci

This repository contains a Python implementation of two heuristic algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), developed for the Intelligent Systems class at UTFPR.

## Algorithms

- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that explores the solution space by accepting worse solutions with a decreasing probability, allowing escape from local minima.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: An evolutionary method that maintains a population of candidate solutions and applies selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better routes.

## Features

- Simple and clear Python code for both algorithms
- Configurable parameters:
  - Temperature, cooling rate, and stopping criteria for Simulated Annealing
  - Population size, number of generations and mutation rates for the Genetic Algorithm

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/caiqfrrz/tsp-heuristic-solvers.git
cd tsp-heuristic-solvers
```
