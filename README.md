# tsp-heuristic-solvers

This repository contains a Python implementation of two heuristic algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), developed for the Intelligent Systems class at UTFPR.

## Algorithms

- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that explores the solution space by accepting worse solutions with a decreasing probability, allowing escape from local minima.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: An evolutionary method that maintains a population of candidate solutions and applies selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better routes.
